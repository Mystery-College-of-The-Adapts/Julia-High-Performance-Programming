# Julia High Performance Programming
This is the code repository for [Julia High Performance Programming]()

##What you will learn

[*] Set up your Julia environment to achieve the highest productivity
[*] Solve your tasks in a high-level dynamic language and use types for your data only when needed
[*] Apply Julia to tackle problems concurrently and in a distributed environment
[*] Get a sense of the possibilities and limitations of Julia's performance
[*] Use Julia arrays to write high performance code
[*] Build a data science project through the entire cycle of ETL, analytics, and data visualization
[*] Display graphics and visualizations to carry out modeling and simulation in Julia
[*] Develop your own packages and contribute to the Julia Community


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
  function drawCircle()
  {
	  var example = document.getElementById('example');
	  var context = example.getContext('2d');
	  context.arc(50, 50, 25,0, 2*Math.PI);
	  context.fillStyle = 'blue';
	  context.fill();
	  context.stroke();
  } 
```
